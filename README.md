# Project-GD
The objective of this project is to build an interface which will help to classify which letter of the American Sign Language (ASL) is being signed, given an image of a signing hand. Such a translator would greatly lower the barrier for many deaf and mute individuals to be able to better communicate with others in day-to-day interactions.
